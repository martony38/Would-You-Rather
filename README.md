# Would You Rather

Source code for my second project for the [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) program from Udacity.

This project is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. Users can answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Requirements
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Installation
Clone or download the repository on your computer.

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`
